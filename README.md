# Financisto

## About

Financisto is an open-source personal finance tracker for Android platform.

Financisto is great and works well.

However its UI is a bit old. I forked the project to add some modifications for myself, ie: update UI. Unfortunately, it is not easy to migrate to mordern UI, and I found some functions are broken by my modifications. This repo is pretty **buggy**. Since only I am using this, so it should be fine.
